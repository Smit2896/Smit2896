### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Smit Doshi!

I'm a Product and Data Science Enthusiast who loves building good products and tackling difficult problems. I'm passionate about crafting meaningful product solutions by combining a user-centric approach with a data-informed mindset.

I strongly believe that there is nothing difficult to learn in this world, itâ€™s just unfamiliar at first. This belief has always pushed me to follow my curiosities and learn as many skills in various fields. (bonus: I love the variety)

My interests include technology, stocks, reading, and exploring the outdoors.

I love meeting new people. Get in touch anytime - doshi.sm@northeastern.edu or connect me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smit--doshi/).
